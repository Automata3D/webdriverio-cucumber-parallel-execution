# webdriverio-cucumber-parallel-execution

A WebdriverIO capability for running **Cucumber** scenarios is parallel.

The capability Segregates the entire Automation Suite into smallest independent chunks (Scenarios) and spawns numerous threads through WebdriverIOs maxInstances feature,thus reducing the Test Execution time drastically and allowing Teams to release much faster.

The Solution is Compatible with multiple versions of Nodejs (Ones supporting Async Await natively as well as ones which do not support it)

Handles merging of reports out of the box and provides a consolidated JSON Report Array, which can be leveraged for Reporting.


# Installation

```
npm install webdriverio-cucumber-parallel-execution
